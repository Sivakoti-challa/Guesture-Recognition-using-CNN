# Guesture-Recognition-using-CNN
The goal is to use a webcam to instantly track the region of interest (ROI), namely, the hand region, in the image range and identify hand gestures for deaf  or human computer interaction fields. Firstly, we use skin color detection and morphology to remove unnecessary background information from the image, and then use background subtraction to detect the ROI. The image size of the ROI is then resized to 64x64 and then entered into the deep convolutional neural network (CNN), in order to identify  multiple hand gestures.  Deep CNN and RNN architectures are developed in this study, respectively. Then, the above process of tracking and recognition is repeated to achieve an instant effect, and the systemâ€™s execution continues until the hand leaves the camera range. Finally, the training data set can reach a recognition rate of 99.73%, and the test data set has a recognition rate of 99.61%, which represents the feasibility of the practical application.
